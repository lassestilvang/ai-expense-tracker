# Code Improvement Suggestions

## Testing
- Implement unit tests for hooks (e.g., useExpenses), components (e.g., ExpenseForm), and utilities using Jest/React Testing Library.
- Add e2e tests with Playwright for critical flows.

## Error Handling
- Add user-facing error notifications (e.g., via toast library) for storage failures, form validation errors, and network issues.
- Improve try-catch blocks in storage.ts with more specific error types.

## Performance Optimizations
- Memoize expensive computations in Dashboard (e.g., category aggregations).
- Use React.memo for components like ExpenseList if re-renders are frequent.
- Consider virtual scrolling for large expense lists.

## Accessibility Improvements
- Add ARIA labels to form fields and buttons.
- Ensure keyboard navigation works for dropdowns and date pickers.
- Test with screen readers.

## Code Quality
- Add JSDoc comments to exported functions.
- Ensure consistent naming (e.g., use camelCase uniformly).
- Add more TypeScript strictness in tsconfig.json.

## Feature Enhancements
- Add search/filter by description.
- Implement bulk delete.
- Support multiple currencies with a settings page.
- Add expense editing inline in the table.

## Security & Privacy
- Add data export/import with encryption options.
- Warn users about local storage limitations (e.g., data loss on browser clear).

## UI/UX Polish
- Add loading states for async operations.
- Implement dark mode toggle.
- Add animations for better feedback (e.g., on form submit).

## State Management
- For scalability, consider migrating to Zustand or Redux Toolkit if the app grows.

## Documentation
- Expand README with API docs, deployment guide, and contribution guidelines.
- Add inline comments for complex logic.
